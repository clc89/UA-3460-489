Term project for 3460:489/589



App name: i$tudent

Main feature:
    Pulls news items from RSS feeds from springboard or instructor's websites so students can have a centralized location for reading news regarding their courses. Information from other sources, such as twitter, can also be used.

Secondary feature:
    Uses a list of all possible CS courses, segregated by either Core or Elective classes
to allow users to manually track what courses they have already taken and what courses they still need. Will display the names of the core classes that the user still needs to take and will display the number of credit hours for electives that the student still needs. 

The app will provide information from several different sources in one centralized location and present it in a more easily read format.

The app will use external data from springboard and instructors' websites and possibly from twitter.
